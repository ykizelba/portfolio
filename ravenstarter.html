<!--
Note how the poem is indented here: https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven. The common pattern is lines 1, 3, and 4 are indented a little--with stanzas 1 and 8 being different (ignore those difference and build all stanzas the same), and line 6 is always indented a lot in every stanza. You must achieve this using pseudo-classes.  Do not create class names for this task.   You should not need to write separate CSS for each stanza.

            <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, </p>
            <p>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- </p>
            <p>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, </p>
            <p>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. </p>
            <p>"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- </p>
            <p>Only this and nothing more." </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;</p>
            <p>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. </p>
            <p>Eagerly I wished the morrow;-vainly I had sought to borrow </p>
            <p>From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Lenore- </p>
            <p>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-</p>
            <p>Nameless here for evermore. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain </p>
            <p>Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; </p>
            <p>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating </p>
            <p>“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door— </p>
            <p>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;— </p>
            <p>This it is and nothing more.” </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, </p>
            <p>“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; </p>
            <p>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, </p>
            <p>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, </p>
            <p>That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;— </p>
            <p>Darkness there and nothing more. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, </p>
            <p>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; </p>
            <p>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, </p>
            <p>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?” </p>
            <p>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”— </p>
            <p>Merely this and nothing more. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, </p>
            <p>Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. </p>
            <p>“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice; </p>
            <p>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore— </p>
            <p>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;— </p>
            <p>’Tis the wind and nothing more!” </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, </p>
            <p>In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore; </p>
            <p>Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;</p>
            <p>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door— </p>
            <p>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door— </p>
            <p>Perched, and sat, and nothing more. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, </p>
            <p>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, </p>
            <p>“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven, </p>
            <p>Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore— </p>
            <p>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”</p>
            <p>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,</p>
            <p>Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore; </p>
            <p>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being </p>
            <p>Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door- </p>
            <p>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, </p>
            <p>With such name as "Nevermore."</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only </p>
            <p>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. </p>
            <p>Nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he fluttered- </p>
            <p>Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have flown before- </p>
            <p>On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before." </p>
            <p>Then the bird said, "Nevermore." </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, </p>
            <p>"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store, </p>
            <p>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster </p>
            <p>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore- </p>
            <p>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore </p>
            <p>Of 'Never- nevermore'."</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, </p>
            <p>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; </p>
            <p>Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking </p>
            <p>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore- </p>
            <p>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore </p>
            <p>Meant in croaking "Nevermore."</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing </p>
            <p>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; </p>
            <p>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining </p>
            <p>On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er, </p>
            <p>But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er, </p>
            <p>She shall press, ah, nevermore! </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer </p>
            <p>Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor. </p>
            <p>"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee- by these angels he hath sent thee</p>
            <p>Respite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore! </p>
            <p>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!" </p>
            <p>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore." </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! - </p>
            <p>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, </p>
            <p>Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted- </p>
            <p>On this home by Horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore- </p>
            <p>Is there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!" </p>
            <p>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore." </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! </p>
            <p>By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adore- </p>
            <p>Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, </p>
            <p>It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore- </p>
            <p>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore." </p>
            <p>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>"Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend," I shrieked, upstarting-</p>
            <p>"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! </p>
            <p>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! </p>
            <p>Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door! </p>
            <p>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!" </p>
            <p>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore." </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting </p>
            <p>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; </p>
            <p>And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, </p>
            <p>And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; </p>
            <p>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor </p>
            <p>Shall be lifted- nevermore! </p>
