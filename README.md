I have taken several classes in which I learned languages such as Java, HTML5, Python, CSS. I have also taken classes that were focusing on SQL, Web Development, Data Analysis, Agile, and Databases. My goal for the future is to develop my programming skills to a higher level through working on different projects with different teams that will at the same time contribute to the company's welfare.

I am part of the Womenâ€™s Tennis Team at DePaul. We compete in the Big East Conference and we have won the conference four times in the last six years and therefore participate in the NCAA tournament. Also, my doubles partner and I had the chance to participate in the ITA All-American and we managed to advance to the round of 16. Through my athletic experience at DePaul, I have gained leadership skills as well as the ability to manage my time and work in a team environment.

Originally, I am from Armavir, Russia. My main interests are politics and sports.
